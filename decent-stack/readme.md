# Purpose
Have the system tools we want to use available without our other `decent` services

### Start `docker-compose up -d`

### Stop `docker-compose stop`

### First Time Setup
1. Complete the CouchDB Setup
   - http://localhost:5984/_utils/#setup
   - Configure Single Node
   - Setup your admin account

** If you destroy your services by running `docker-compose down` you'll need to do this again. **
